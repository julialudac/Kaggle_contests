This is a very na√Øve implementation !!!


- Classifier used = the worst: Least Square (which is a linear classifier). Better classifiers: Support Vector machine, Adaboost, Neural nets,...
- Feature extraction: ignoring and taking certain fields one by one
- Dealing with outliers: while training, igoring rows with no data at interesting fields, while testing: considering dead if no data at interesting fields
- Using loops everywhere
